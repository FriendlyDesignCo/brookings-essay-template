  <p class=".lead">When Edward Snowden hit the send button on a laptop in Hong Kong last June, just shy of his 30th birthday, he became the poster boy for an acutely American conundrum: the tension between the government's constitutional commitment to the privacy of individuals and its responsibility for the safety of the nation.</p>
  <p>A precocious computer whiz, Snowden had worked on network security for the Central Intelligence Agency before becoming a systems administrator on contract to the National Security Agency. In both capacities, he had pledged not to divulge state secrets. He had also taken an oath to "defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic." The Chinese government's decision to let him pause in Hong Kong while fleeing arrest, and the Kremlin's grant of asylum, complete with Russian President Vladimir Putin's endorsement of Snowden's "honor," guaranteed that he would be condemned as a traitor in the United States.</p>

  <p>Two of them are U.S. senators: Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a liberal on reproductive freedom, gay rights, and gun control but, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the NSA's most powerful congressional defender; and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the agency's leading critic on Capitol Hill. The other two are outside government: Joel Brenner, a former NSA inspector general who is still broadly, but not uncritically, supportive of the agency; and Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a leader of the movement to bar the NSA from hoovering up phone records and curb its surveillance of Internet and other electronic communications.</p>
  <p>All four not only believe deeply in the Constitution — they know it well. Despite their differences, they also understand that the right to privacy is itself a conundrum, and that it has become more so with the passage of time. Therefore all four would agree with the proposition that there need to be reforms that take account of a changing world. What those reforms should be is where they come to a parting of the ways.</p>

<div id="founders" class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
  <h2 class="hed">The Founders' Intent</h2>
  <p>The Fourth Amendment, which obligates the U.S. government to ensure that citizens "be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures," was ratified by Congress as part of the Bill of Rights 223 years ago. Until the invention of modern communications technologies, it was fairly easy for citizens to know whether the authorities were rummaging through their property. To search a home or office, officers of the law had to physically enter. The Fourth Amendment generally prevented that from happening without a warrant and gave owners the right to challenge whether entries and confiscations were "reasonable."</p>
  <p>Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, however, technological advances made it easier for the government to "search and seize" the contents of private communications without citizens' knowledge, thus depriving them of the ability to object. Wiretapping is almost as old as the telegraph, going back at least to the Civil War. Phone tapping has been an instrument of law enforcement and counterespionage since the beginning of the 20th century. An early instance of it was useful in probing the intentions of real and potential foreign enemies. In the first months of 1917, the British intercepted, decoded, and passed to Washington the "Zimmermann telegram": a proposal from the Kaiser Wilhelm II's foreign minister to the Mexican government promising that if Mexico allied itself with Germany in the event that the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies, Germany would reward it with the return of formerly Mexican territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The revelation helped stoke support for Congress's declaration of war that April.</p>

    <blockquote>The Zimmermann Telegram<br>

    <p><img alt="opening mail illustration" id="openmail2" src="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/essays/bigsnoop/images/readmail2.png" class="pull-left col-xs-3">However, once the war had ended, President Herbert Hoover's secretary of state, Henry Stimson, famously shut down the "Black Chamber," a precursor of the NSA, which had begun intercepting and decoding foreign diplomats' cables in peacetime, too. "Gentlemen," Stimson harrumphed, "don't read each other's mail."</p>
    <p>Others in the U.S. government were not so naïve. By the late thirties, Army and Navy intelligence officers, aided by civilian experts and technicians, were decoding diplomatic cables from Tokyo. By New Year's Day 1941, they were picking up hints that Japan was preparing to attack the United States. But there was a failure of what today would be called "connecting the dots." As a result, the nation's leaders — including Stimson, who was then Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of war — took no action to protect the Pacific Fleet.</p>
    <p>Senator Feinstein, the daughter of an air raid warden in San Francisco, was 8 years old in December that year. Pearl Harbor, she feels, engendered her hawkish views on national security and intelligence. She remembers the blackout after the attack and a submarine net draped across the Golden Gate to prevent the Japanese from sneaking into San Francisco Bay.</p>
    <p>Joel Brenner views that national trauma as a reminder that there are two varieties of intelligence failure — not only over-zealousness or abuse, but also &ldquo;the failure to collect or understand critical information&rdquo; in time to identify a threat and provide enough advance warning to prepare for it or, better yet, preempt it; and that public policy makers must address both.</p>
    <p>Four years after the end of World War II, America saw another critical intelligence failure. The Soviets tested an atomic bomb in 1949, considerably sooner than U.S. experts had estimated. Three years later, President Harry Truman created the NSA. Its mandate was to eavesdrop on foreign governments and their agents, particularly those in the Communist world, because the cold war, which was fought in the shadows rather than on battlefields and the high seas, put a premium on covert means of offense and defense.</p>
    <p>From its headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland, the NSA went quietly about the highly technical business of gathering "signals intelligence," keeping its head down so successfully that the initials were said to stand for "No Such Agency." The CIA, by contrast, specialized in "human intelligence," i.e., information gathered by American agents and moles inside foreign governments. That made it a source of fascination to the public, and the subject of many a Hollywood thriller.</p>
    <div id="facts2" class="pull-left col-sm-6">

</div>
<p>The nation's spymasters also undertook covert operations that sometimes went disastrously awry, putting the CIA at the center of a series of public embarrassments. One of the earliest and most damaging was the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Senator Wyden traces his jaundiced view of covert operations to that episode. His journalist father, Peter, wrote a revelatory and scathing book on the inside story of the invasion, which he likened to "Waterloo staged by the Marx Brothers." The same could be said of the ignominious end of the Nixon presidency, brought about by a wiretapping caper mounted at the behest of the White House by a ragtag band that included several former operatives of the FBI and the CIA.</p>
<p>Watergate shocked the American public and spurred many of its representatives in Congress to demand an investigation into the past activities of both organizations as well as the NSA and others. The result was the creation of two congressional committees in 1975, chaired by Frank Church (D-ID) in the Senate and Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) in the House of Representatives. Their hearings exposed secret, arguably illegal wiretapping, bugging, and harassment of American citizens, including Supreme Court justices, reporters, and government officials, all in the name of collecting intelligence about threats to national security. The most notorious case, first exposed in the 1960s and fully documented by the Church Committee, was the wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr. by the NSA and by the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, who believed him to be part of a Communist conspiracy.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to the Church Committee — the forerunner of the one that Dianne Feinstein now chairs — the NSA was no longer immune to public censure and strengthened oversight. The committee helped bring to light the NSA's Project SHAMROCK, which had been part of a 30-year surveillance of telegraphic and telephonic data coming into and out of the United States. Many of the senders and recipients were American citizens who were targeted without warrants or court authorization. Senator Church called it "probably the largest governmental interception program affecting Americans ever undertaken."</p>
<p>As a result of these investigations, Congress passed, and Jimmy Carter signed into law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978. Its purpose was to buttress the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure by putting a layer of judicial review between the intelligence agencies and their surveillance targets — at least when those targets are U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens. FISA has undergone numerous revisions over the last three decades. As currently written, it prohibits the government from intentionally targeting for electronic eavesdropping any "U.S. person" anywhere, or any foreigner located inside the U.S., without a warrant issued by a member of the special, secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court (FISA Court). To get a warrant from the court, the government has to show "probable cause" to believe that the target is operating as an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist group.</p>

<p>For more than three decades, the FISA Court — much like the NSA, whose surveillance activities it sometimes oversees — kept its head down. The court held secret proceedings in a secure vault first in the Justice Department, then later in the main federal courthouse in Washington, D.C. Its judges, chosen by the chief justice of the United States from the ranks of federal judges around the country, heard arguments almost entirely from government lawyers. All its decisions were classified, and very few were appealed, if only because potential plaintiffs were not aware that their communications had been intercepted, and if they had suspicions, they had no proof.</p>
<p>The basic post-Watergate compromise — that executive branch surveillance programs would be guarded from public scrutiny but closely overseen by all three branches of government — prevailed through the 1990s. By then, the Soviet Union had disappeared from the map.</p>
<p>With the cold war over, the new, increasingly preoccupying threat to America was personified by Osama bin Laden. Believed to have connections to the bombers of the World Trade Center in New York in 1993, he was indicted for the destruction of two U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 and his organization, al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on the USS Cole at harbor in Yemen in October 2000. The emergence of this new menace to America and its allies brought an upsurge in political and public support for aggressive surveillance of potential terrorists, and a muting of the concerns that had arisen in the 1970s about the past sins and excessive zeal of U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>

  <p>Then, literally out of the blue on a sunny fall morning, came the clincher. Feinstein recounted to me what it was like watching television as the Twin Towers burned. She cannot get out of her head "the slap, slap, slap of bodies hitting the canopy next door." She, like all but one of her colleagues in the Senate, joined the bipartisan rush to adopt the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Patriot Act), which widened the scope of the government's electronic surveillance, search and seizure, and other investigative powers.</p>

  </div>
  <p>In the months before 9/11, Joel Brenner had been trying cases as a founding partner in a Washington, D.C. law firm. As he walked home from work that Tuesday evening, fires were still burning at the Pentagon. It was then that he decided he wanted to go to work for "the people who were chasing the bastards who were blowing us up." He spent four years as the NSA's inspector general, then three years as the nation's top counterintelligence official, and then another 15 months as the NSA's senior counsel.</p>
  <p>Ron Wyden also joined the nearly unanimous vote for the Patriot Act shortly after the 9/11 attacks. But before long he came to a conclusion that was nearly the opposite of Feinstein's and Brenner's. He worried that the pendulum was swinging too far away from a proper regard for the Constitution and would inevitably lead to abuses by the intelligence community. In 2003, he led the battle in the Senate that defunded the Total Information Awareness program, a Pentagon unit established to hunt down terrorists by scouring mountains of data to reconstruct the electronic footprints of millions of people.</p>
  <p>However, just as Wyden feared, the prevailing sentiment on Capitol Hill was that the reforms of the 1970s had impeded the NSA from uncovering the 9/11 plot in time to prevent the attacks. It was in that atmosphere that two new programs were put into place during George W. Bush's presidency.</p>
  <p>In 2006, the FISA Court secretly authorized the NSA to collect from phone companies the records of trillions of phone calls made within, to, or from the United States for analysis and storage. The purpose of this gigantic undertaking was to identify foreign terrorists' actual, possible, or potential collaborators who were on American soil. It came to be known as the "bulk phone records program," or the "Section 215 program," after a provision in the Patriot Act that allowed the government to demand access to "any tangible things," so long as the government specified that they were "relevant to an authorized investigation… to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities."</p>

  </div>
  <p>Two years later, near the end of the Bush presidency, Congress passed Section 702, an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, authorizing the targeting of communications of "foreign persons who are located abroad." This provision became the basis for sweeping, clandestine NSA programs including one called PRISM, an acronym for "Planning Tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization, and Management." It was actually a gargantuan collection tool that enabled the NSA to gather from U.S.-based Internet companies hundreds of millions of emails, Internet voice calls, videos, photos, chat services, stored data, and other private Internet communications, if the targets were "reasonably believed" to be non-U.S. persons overseas who possessed "foreign intelligence information."</p>
  <p>Unlike the phone-records program, PRISM made available to the NSA the contents of the communications that were collected. At least nine U.S.-based companies were compelled by the surveillance court to cooperate with the NSA in facilitating access to PRISM data: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo!, Paltalk, AOL, YouTube, and Skype. The companies rarely appealed court orders, and complied with alacrity. Patriotism was certainly a factor, but so was their reliance on the government for business, security clearances, help with network security, and other benefits.</p>

  <p>Looking back on the relentless growth of the NSA's mandate in the aftermath of 9/11, the usually upbeat, 6-foot, 4-inch Wyden knits his brow in frustration over how few of his colleagues in the Senate wanted to hear about "the always-expanding surveillance state that hour by hour chips needlessly away at [our] liberties [without] making us any safer." As he sums it up, the overall message he kept trying to deliver in the pre-Snowden era was that "When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act, they will be stunned, and they will be angry." When I spoke to him about his struggle during those years, he recalled it as "dispiriting and lonely."</p>
  <p>As a member of the Intelligence Committee that Feinstein chairs, Wyden has been obliged to keep the secrets that the executive branch shares with it. So he has had to tread carefully when questioning administration witnesses in public hearings. Nonetheless, in March last year — three months before the Snowden leaks — Wyden asked James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, at a public hearing: "Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"</p>

  <p>"No," responded Clapper, but he added "not wittingly" in response to a follow-up question. Even with the caveat, it was a falsehood, though it was not widely chronicled until after the Snowden leak. Clapper claims it resulted from an honest misunderstanding of the question.</p>
  <p>Insofar as Wyden's admonitions were applauded in previous years, it was most frequently by civil-liberty activists like Jameel Jaffer, who vigorously opposed the government's aggressive response to 9/11. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, Jaffer was just starting what would probably have been a highly lucrative career working on equity derivatives at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, one of the nation's top corporate law firms. A graduate of Harvard law school and editor of its law review, he began to dedicate his spare time to pro bono work with the ACLU, which was representing some of the more than a thousand Muslim immigrants in the United States who were rounded up on immigration charges in the months following the attacks.

  <p>None of the detainees turned out to be terrorists. And Jaffer, born to a Muslim family in Canada, had found his calling. He left his firm and went to work full time for the ACLU.</p>
  <p>But just as Wyden belonged to a small minority in Congress, Jaffer's opposition to the government's response to 9/11 put him at odds with U.S. public opinion. The near-unanimous votes in Congress and in the polls reflected overwhelming support for the Patriot Act.</p>
  <p>However, that mood, both on Capitol Hill and among the public, faded over the course of the dozen years between 9/11 and the Snowden leaks, first gradually, then precipitously, as the military adventures the George W. Bush administration launched in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the global war on terror turned into costly quagmires. In the second term of Bush's presidency, more and more Americans questioned his judgment and wanted a return to normalcy, a sentiment that helped Barack Obama win the White House. But thanks to legislative gridlock, a federal shutdown, and budget sequestration, his election did not stanch the hemorrhaging of the citizenry's confidence in its government.</p>
